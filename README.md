# Solidity in Browser Demo

Project to test and demonstrate how to use Solidity in the browser.

This branch shows how to polyfill the node dependencies of the solc-js in a Create React App project.

Here we've added `@craco/craco` and the `craco.config.js` file to the project to override the webpack configuration.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
